This film has things ranging from violent stabbings to (at times) quite a sad story . There are many over the top fight scenes in this film with many stabbings but these are done without great detail , but still show realistic blood wounds . There is a lot of blood in this film but all of it is dried so nothing to shocking with the blood is shown . The fight scenes can also be very violent with lots of bashing in them and lots of dried blood shown and the baddie in one scene repeatedly kicks the hero even when he's given up , but this scene is very short and no blood is shown in this part .","category":"action/Sci-fi","language":"English","industry":"hollywood","banner":"Marvel Studios","producer":"Kevin Feige","director":"Ryan Coogler","cast":"Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. ,Jordan Lupita, Nyong'o Danai, Gurira Martin, Freeman Daniel, Kaluuya Letitia, Wright Winston, Duke Angela, Bassett Forest, Whitaker Andy, Serkis","poster":"assets/img/poster/blackpanther.png","description":"Thousands of years ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing the metal vibranium.
